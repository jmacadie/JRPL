<h2>How does it work?</h2>
<ul>
	<li>Predict the exact score in every match in the 2014 World Cup</li>
	<li>Change your prediction as many times as you like before the match</li>
	<li>Matches will be locked down from further prediction <strong>30 minutes</strong> before kick-off</li>
	<li>The system will send an e-mail at lock-down saying what every player predicted for that match</li>
	<li>After the match is over and someone has posted the result</li>
