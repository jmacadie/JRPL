<div class="alert alert-info">I've got a four lettered word for you...</div>
<h2>How does it work?</h2>
<ul>
	<li>Predict the exact score in every match in the 2014 World Cup</li>
	<li>Change your prediction as many times as you like before the match</li>
	<li>Matches will be locked down from further prediction <strong>30 minutes</strong> before kick-off</li>
	<li>The system will send an e-mail at lock-down saying what every player predicted for that match</li>
	<li>After the match is over, and someone has posted the result, the predictions will be scores as follows:
		<ul>
			<li><strong>3 points</strong> for the correct result (e.g. Brazil Win, Draw, Croatia Win) and scoreline, <i>or</i></li>
			<li><strong>1 point</strong> for the correct result but the wrong scoreline, <i>or</i></li>
			<li><strong>0 points</strong> if you get the result wrong</li>
		</ul>
	</li>
	<li>In the kncok-out stages it is <strong>the score after extra time</strong> that counts.
	Penalties are ignored from the prediction and draws can therefore still be predicted</li>
</ul>
<h2>Prizes</h2>
There will be an overall league for most points across the entire tournament
plus three sub-leagues for the individual parts of the tournament:
<ul>

	<li>The Rest - Quater-Finals, Semis-Finals, 3<sup>rd</sup> 4<sup>th</sup> Place Play-off & Final (8 matches)</li>
</ul>
